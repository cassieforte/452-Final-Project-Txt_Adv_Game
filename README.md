# The Haunted House
The Haunted House is a text adventure game written by Cassandra Forte as a final project for IS452: Foundations of Information Processing. In this game, players will navigate the many rooms of a Haunted House looking for a way to escape. Players will choose between three directions in each room they visit: left, right, and straight. The house does not make sense; you will get lost.   

## Getting Started and How to Play

The player will need to run the code in a python environment, such as PyCharm. The story progresses through lines of text, which will inform the player which room they're in. Look for hints in the text to determine the best direction to pick, and try to remember where you have and have not been. The key to success can be in unlikely places. 

Players will need to navigate the house and locate the key in order to win the game. There are several directions that will lead to death. In the event of death, the program will end and the player can choose to restart the game from the beginning.
